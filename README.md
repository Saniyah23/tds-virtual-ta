# TDS Virtual TA

A FastAPI-based assistant that answers student queries related to the "Tools in Data Science" course.

It uses two sources:
- **IITM Discourse forum data** (scraped manually and saved as `my_tds_forum_data.json`).
- **Official course notes** (parsed from markdown into `tds_book.json`).

## How to Use

Send a POST request to the `/api` endpoint with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "question": "How do I submit Assignment 2?"
}
```

The response will include:
- **`answer`**: A Markdown-formatted summary of relevant snippets.
- **`links`**: An array of objects with `url` and `text` fields referencing the forum thread or course note.
