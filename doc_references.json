Hi @22f3001315 , You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made. Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body Vision - OpenAI API. Kind regards Jivraj it worked thanks sir Are we supposed to buy open ai api key ? No, if you scroll down to the last question, we can get our Ai Proxy key @nilaychugh @22f3002034 The API key is available at https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/ The instructions on how to use the token is given at GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions. You get a limit of $1. Use with care. Kind regards but the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI Hi Nilay, Yes you would need to use text-embedding-3-small model of openai for embedding questions. Kind regards Jivraj i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it\u2019ll show as correct, but then if i  run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, is there any solution to this problem?

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection. Hi samra, Try installing some other browser see if that works.

Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed? Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?

Function calling is better approach here. Hi @24f2006531 You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer) Kind regards will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.) @Jivraj  sir Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement? Mostly problem statement like different cities etc Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project. my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on?

Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I\u2019ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses. However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different. Is this information available to everyone @carlton sir? Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well. As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7. Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks\u2014perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment. We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well. Looking forward to your kind consideration. Best regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama The Same happened to me. They should have informed this before. Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well.

Best regards, HARSH JAYSWAL @s.anand @carlton same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter. @carlton @s.anand There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn\u2019t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I\u2019m seeing in groups that there\u2019s an \u201cextra benefit\u201d being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief \u2014 grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response \u2014 hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students. @carlton sir , This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain  GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ? Kindly consider same for me also \u2026 Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA\u2019s instead of one GA. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand. It\u2019s really unfair It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this. Regards: Akash @carlton I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard \u2014 and sadly, I\u2019m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile. Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn\u2019t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they\u2019ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn\u2019t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V.

Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too in the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not @carlton  @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated \u201cbest 4 out of 7\u201d policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn\u2019t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request. Thank you @carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this Thanking you waiting for your answer"}, {"type": "discourse", "title": "Repeat course", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/repeat-course/171798", "content": "Repeat course Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?

If you have passed it, its better to move on. @carlton Sir, It is my humble request to kindly give atleast 2 bonus marks like any other subject, if i will get 2 marks as bonus my grade will stay good otherwise it will fall badly. Sir plzzz it is my request. Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective). So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time. This is not up to us.

In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.  The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support. Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous. For instance:  forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.  but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified? Let\u2019s wait for their response. I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4 @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Can you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it\u2019s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that\u2019s not your problem). Thanks Hi @all Question intends you to select most correlated one. Select option which is absolute highest. @Jivraj  - Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer.

Thanks Sujay D @carlton, please release the mock or give us the proper resources. The resources in the course introduction and the pyqs have no similarities. Many questions come from other topics, such as MLT and many others. Those who didn\u2019t complete it find it too difficult. Please don\u2019t keep us in delusion. Going through GA\u2019s would be good idea. Yes sir please it will help us to prepare better for end term. Yes sir we all are facing the same problem. The Tuesday and the Thursday session will cover end term including a mock. End term is usually very easy for TDS. A look at prior end terms is a good indicator of how easy they are. Kind regards @Carlton With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion. I\u2019m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns? Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2\u20133 most important topics\u2014maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.\u2014to give more attention to? I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These \u201cminor\u201d things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards Sir, Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of \u2018LICENSE\u2019 to \u2018MIT LICENSE\u2019 on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou! One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th. Well noted sir. Thanks a lot!

As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux? @Jivraj @carlton The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with. For more information watch this video https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat or watch TDS Live Sessions. Regards, TDS TA what frameworks can we use? hopefully anything? or what frameworks can\u2019t we use? @carlton   @Jivraj Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are: Deliverables, and an example of the Evaluation has been provided. If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered. Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764\u00d71764 374 KB Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards @23f1002382 You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks. Kind regards A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip \u00b7 sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public \u00b7 GitHub You can use this to validate your code for Project 1. Please note:  This is a sample. It WILL change. Don\u2019t rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:  Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times) Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations   Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month. For those who submit their code by Friday, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.  @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini - please socialize this during the live sessions.

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA)   GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)   GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.   2. Project Updates  Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?  (thread link)  3. ROE Score Update  While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.  I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay tigertds212\u00d7148 6.99 KB @carlton It\u2019s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well\u2014when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.     lakshaygarg654:  GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.   The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.     lakshaygarg654:  Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.   Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.     lakshaygarg654:  3. ROE Score Update  While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.    You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards We do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster. Thanks, Kind regards Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response.

Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end. The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm. We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.

Its a timed mock. atleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions live session gmeet link is not available? After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult. where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ? thanks When will it reopen? dear @carlton when will yesterday\u2019s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube? @23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:  The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is.  The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced  Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students\u2014including those from non-technical backgrounds\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.  Project Complexity &amp; Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.  Course Structure Changes &amp; Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for working professionals and students without prior experience.  Remote Open Exam (RoE) &amp; Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort\u2014spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives. Yes sir please look into this @Anand @Bharathi Yes ma\u2019am please pay attention to our concern. Yes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request. @carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj , @Anand Yes @s.anand sir @jkmadathil  sir @Bharathi Mam, Plss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam. Right, I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today\u2019s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That\u2019s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard. Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I\u2019d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered \u201cimpossible\u201d by students: What\u2019s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring &amp; Scheduling Issues  Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.  Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:  Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.  I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response. Please look into it sir. Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.  TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:   This course is quite hard Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:  It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. #  Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you\u2019re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.   TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand:   We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you\u2019ve learnt.   Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.  Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I\u2019m speaking for a lot of my peers that we\u2019re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course. I\u2019m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don\u2019t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I\u2019m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can\u2019t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass. Nicely highlighted the concern of all students. TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It\u2019s a headache for those with non-technical background. IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis. Dam\u2026 Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I\u2019m still getting dragged into this   \u2026 But still this is a huge Problem \u2026      jkmadathil:  LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. # #   Great! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too. Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well! Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir\u2019s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult. You will survive.

Tools in Data Science           @ankit.jain \u2013 I\u2019m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.  What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning.   Implicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer if woken up from sleep?\u201d Explicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer given time and Internet?\u201d  Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They\u2019ll answer those in a few seconds.  Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That\u2019s explicit learning. But it takes time\u2026      Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.    On another topic  et?   read the post, its about explicit learning xD EDIT its implicit my bad ! off topic, how do you dm people on discourse?

I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM. Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared. Thanks and Regards Shalini Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time\u2026 It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards hi @carlton how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance! You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form. I will also add the same in the student seek portal. Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either! The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team. Kind regards 3 questions:-  will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? will the live solving video lecture be recorded?      23f1002382:  will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?   They will be available after the live session has finished.     23f1002382:  will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?   We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1     23f1002382:  will the live solving video lecture be recorded?   Yes our live sessions will be recorded. thanks for the prompt response! Cheers . Also to my understanding at sharp 7:00 we get email with form link and questions dataset? Hi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.     carlton:  No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session.   yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks, also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta Hi @shubhamatkal , For question1 provided answer is wrong. Regarding yesterday\u2019s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that\u2019s requried to solve questions.

How this is beneficial?  As the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term  Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well. Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic). @Yogesh GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions. We do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet. Kind regards @carlton If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance. Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.

Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these.  Syllabus kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time Any mock or resource to practice from? additional tips, if any   Modules 1 - 5 Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame. We will have some past ROEs as practise \u2026 watch sessions  Kind regards Thanks for the answer @carlton Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a \u201cGA with extremely short deadline\u201d since we don\u2019t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure. Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs?? ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc. Kind regards The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you\u2026 past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the \u201chooomann\u201d  So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test? Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens. Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins."}, {"type": "discourse", "title": "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959", "content": "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Please post any questions related to Graded Assignment 4 - Data Sourcing.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15? @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade.

Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \" i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this Convert your MP3 to Text for Free Online, it worked"}, {"type": "discourse", "title": "GA5 Score Not Reflecting in The Page After Deadline", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-score-not-reflecting-in-the-page-after-deadline/168017", "content": "GA5 Score Not Reflecting in The Page After Deadline Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.41.09 AM2940\u00d71912 443 KB Is this something to worry about?

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome. The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680 So the reason for the failure is: You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM) Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections. Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=\u201c21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471\u201d] image250\u00d7534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place. We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students. Kind regards @carlton sir Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was. I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn\u2019t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I\u2019d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered  Kind regards, Arnav Mehta 21f3002647 Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository.

Yes @s.anand , @carlton , The project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress and let us submit better work. Additionally, some extra help sessions would be really helpful to clarify our doubts. @carlton @s.anand yes sir please extend the project deadline. Sir please extend the deadline it\u2019s really hard to do we need more time Yes, it\u2019s too hectic to balance work and this project @carlton @s.anand sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn\u2019t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we\u2019ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us. @carlton  @s.anand  sir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also scheduled on Saturday Please extend the deadline  @s.anand @carlton sir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it\u2019s very difficult,  we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the project and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extended\u2026 Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension. Kindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. @carlton @s.anand Indeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them. EXTEND !!! Kindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have their GATE exam on Saturday. A slight extension would be greatly helpful. SIr please extend the deadline of project 1 give us  2 to 3 days it was helpful for us. @22f1000376 @22f3000276 @23f2004636 @23f2004563 @sharik4real @Mystic_9803 @Rishabh2 @23f1002279 @varun_parashar @22f2001175 and others\u2026 I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:  We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.  All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team -Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used. @carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project. Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B. Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -   Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.   Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.   Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):  You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv.  If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity.

Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow. @carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head . Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular?              If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it              followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases              But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently. Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:   Isolation \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.   Reproducibility \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.   Portability \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.     Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)  \u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing. \u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.  Using requirements.txt  \u2022 Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. \u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt \u2022 If you don\u2019t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. \u2022 If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts \u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. \u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: \u2022 Using greater than/less than constraints: package&gt;=1.2,&lt;2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). \u2022 Running pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary  Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.  Kind regards For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.  For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement       24f2006531:  Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?   Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.      24f2006531:  My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation   The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.  Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you  Thank you sir for clarifying.     carlton:  \u2022 Using greater than/less than constraints: package&gt;=1.2,&lt;2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).   I wasn\u2019t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question."}, {"type": "discourse", "title": "Live Session Agenda - 30/01/2025", "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/live-session-agenda-30-01-2025/165830", "content": "Live Session Agenda - 30/01/2025 Hi All, The agenda items for the live session 30/01/2025 are:  What is Rest API?

I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project. Kind regards Thanks @carlton  I would definitely refine it.

This course exposes you to real-life tools  Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.  But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?  These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:  - You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself. - You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace. - You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.  [![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)  In this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.  Learn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.     This course is quite hard  Here's students' feedback:  - [2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268) - It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.

It'll be too tough for you now.     But it's probably worth it.  Here's students' feedback:  - [Course experience and farewell post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/course-experience-and-farewell-post/173247)     Programming skills are a pre-requisite  You need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.  **But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.  In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.  This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.     If you passed, don't enroll again  The course is public, so you can always audit it.  Also, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625).    We encourage learning by sharing  You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).  **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.  **To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.  **To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.    ## We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks  The content evolves with technology and feedback.

Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now. - **Remote exams are open and hard**   - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...   - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2) - **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy. - **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context. - **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks) - **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.   - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time.

And to get the data set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module.  How do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module.  - The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them? - The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured. - Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find?  This will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet or within your organization or even within your phones.  ## Sources of Data  [![Sources of Data](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GY5l_5RpVZM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GY5l_5RpVZM)  - [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) - [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) - [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/) - [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/) - [Datameet](https://datameet.org/)  ## Types of datasets  [![Types of datasets](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/u8PIxqsi1kk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/u8PIxqsi1kk)  - Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles - Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email - Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video - [DBF opener](https://www.dbfopener.com/) - [MapShaper lets you view Shapefiles](https://mapshaper.org/)  ## Types of values  [![Types of values](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HlsqT0r9wAM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/HlsqT0r9wAM)  - Categorical values may be:   - Boolean: True or False   - Unordered: No order, like colors   - Ordered: Order, like ratings   - Cyclical: Like days of the week   - Unstructured: Like names, images - Numerical values may be:   - Integer: You can add or subtract   - Real: You can multiply or divide - Composite values have an internal structure   - Temporal: Date, Time   - Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles   - Structured: JSON, XML with schema   - Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc.  ## Week Summary  [![Discover the Data - Summary](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NNiFxgANu8Y/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y)  Based on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is.  Both of these are powerful skills.  The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to. Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building.  The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with. Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work. You don't have to extract information from it. Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure. So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort.  ## Sample questions  - Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01) - What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: ) - Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured. They have author names, abstracts, keywords, etc. but most content is free-form.) - Are book titles categorical or composite? (ANS: Categorical. They don't have an underlying structure.)  ## Optional: Tools used in the industry  Kathir Mani from QueLit and Anand S from Gramener discuss the tools and technologies used in the industry.

It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.  Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):  [![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)  Here's how it works:  - It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters - ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4) - There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs - Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)  Common Python operations with Base64:  ```python import base64  # Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" # Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World! # Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==  # Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f:     binary_data = f.read()     image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()  # Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\" ```  Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.  For example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:  ```html  ```  Base64 is used in many places:  - JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads - Email: MIME attachments encoding - Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers - JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication - SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format - SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO - Git: Encoding binary files in patches  Tools for working with Base64:  - [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding - [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Bash", "filename": "bash.md", "content": "## Terminal: Bash  UNIX shells are the de facto standard in the data science world and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the most popular.

For example:  - **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing - **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content - **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption - **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms - **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization - **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats - **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers  This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line.  ### defuddle-cli  [defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.  ```bash find . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\; ```  - `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found - `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting - `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown - `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension  ### Pandoc  [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.  Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.  [![How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPSK7q13-40/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)  ```bash find . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\; ```  - `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found - `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion - `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown - `-o {}.md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument  ### Lynx  [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.  ```bash find . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} + ```  - `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency - `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch - `lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text   - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout   - `-nolist`: Don't include the list of links at the end - `> \"${f%.html}.txt\"`: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name  ### w3m  [w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.  ```bash find . -type f -name '*.html' \\   -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\       w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\     done' _ {} + ```  - `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency - `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch - `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\"`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML   - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout   - `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML   - `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns   - `-no-graph`: Don't show graphic characters for tables and frames - `> \"${f%.html}.md\"`: Save output to a .md file with the same base name  ### Comparison  | Approach     | Speed     | Format Quality | Preservation                       | Best For                        | | ------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | | defuddle-cli | Slow      | High           | Good structure and links           | Content migration, publishing   | | pandoc       | Slow      | Very High      | Almost everything                  | Academic papers, documentation  | | lynx         | Fast      | Low            | Basic structure only               | Quick extraction, large batches | | w3m          | Very Slow | Medium-Low     | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx  |  ### Optimize Batch Processing  1. **Process in parallel**: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:     ```bash    find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"    ```  2. **Filter files before processing**:     ```bash    find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;    ```  3. **Customize output format** with additional parameters:     ```bash    # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting    find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;    ```  4. **Handle errors gracefully**:     ```bash    find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +    ```  ### Choosing the Right Tool  - **Need speed with minimal formatting?** Use the lynx approach - **Need precise, complete conversion?** Use pandoc - **Need a balance of structure and cleanliness?** Try defuddle-cli - **Working with complex tables?** w3m might render them better  Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.  ### Combined Crawling and Conversion  Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](#crawl4ai) or [markdown-crawler](#markdown-crawler).  1. **For research/data collection**: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion 2. **For simple website archiving**: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution 3. **For high-quality conversion**: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion 4. **For maximum speed**: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline  ### Crawl4AI  [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.  ```bash uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install crawl4ai crawl4ai-setup ```  - `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv) - `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax) - `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package - `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai's required dependencies  ### markdown-crawler  [markdown-crawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It's efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.  ```bash uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install markdown-crawler markdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ```  - `uv venv` and activation: Same as above - `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package - `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options:   - `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling   - `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels   - `-b ./markdown`: Sets the base output directory   - Final argument is the starting URL"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Convert Pdfs To Markdown", "filename": "convert-pdfs-to-markdown.md", "content": "## Converting PDFs to Markdown  PDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).  Use Cases:  - **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training - **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents - **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication - **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis - **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers - **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers - **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation  ### PyMuPDF4LLM  [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.  PyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.  ```bash PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))' ```  - `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale - `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package - `python -c '...'`: Executes Python code directly from the command line - `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module - `h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output - `h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file  ## Markitdown  [![Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v65Oyddfxeg/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg)  [Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.  ```bash PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md ```  - `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding - `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager - `$FILE.pdf`: The input PDF file - `> markitdown.md`: Redirects output to a markdown file  ### Unstructured  [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.  ## GROBID  If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.  ```bash # Start GROBID service docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2  # Process PDF with curl curl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml ```  ### Mistral OCR API  [Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.  ## Azure Document Intelligence API  For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities.  ### Other libraries  [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.  [MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.  ## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools  | Tool         | Strengths                                | Weaknesses                   | Best For                             | | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | | PyMuPDF4LLM  | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch             | AI training data, semantic structure | | Markitdown   | Multi-format support, simple usage       | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents    | | Unstructured | Wide format support, active development  | Can be resource-intensive    | Production pipelines, integration    | | GROBID       | Reference extraction excellence          | Narrower use case            | Academic papers, citations           | | Docling      | Advanced document understanding          | Installation difficulties    | Research applications                | | MegaParse    | Comprehensive approach                   | Requires OpenAI API          | Complex documents, OCR needs         |  How to pick:  - **Need LLM-ready content?** PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this - **Working with multiple document formats?** Markitdown handles diverse inputs - **Extracting academic references?** GROBID remains the standard - **Building a production pipeline?** Unstructured offers the best integration options - **Handling complex layouts?** Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence  The optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.  ## Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion  1. **Pre-process PDFs** when possible:     ```bash    # Optimize a PDF for text extraction first    ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdf    ```  2. **Try multiple tools** on the same document to compare results:  3. **Handle scanned PDFs** appropriately:     ```bash    # For scanned documents, run OCR first    ocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf    PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf > markitdown.md    ```  4. **Consider post-processing** for better results:     ```bash    # Simple post-processing example    sed -i 's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g' output.md  # Add line breaks after sentences    ```"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Correlation With Excel", "filename": "correlation-with-excel.md", "content": "## Correlation with Excel  [![Correlation with Excel](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lXHCyhO7DmY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/lXHCyhO7DmY)  You'll learn to calculate and interpret correlations using Excel, covering:  - **Enabling the Data Analysis Tool Pack**: Steps to enable the Excel data analysis tool pack. - **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding statistical association between variables. - **Creating a Correlation Matrix**: Steps to generate and interpret a correlation matrix. - **Scatterplots and Trendlines**: Plotting data and adding trend lines to visualize correlations. - **Analyzing Results**: Comparing correlation coefficients and understanding their implications. - **Insights and Further Analysis**: Interpreting scatterplots and planning further analysis for deeper insights.

It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.  [![Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pLfH5TZBGXo/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo)  To crawl the [IIT Madras Data Science Program website](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) for example, you could run:  ```bash wget \\   --recursive \\   --level=3 \\   --no-parent \\   --convert-links \\   --adjust-extension \\   --compression=auto \\   --accept html,htm \\   --directory-prefix=./ds \\   https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ```  Here's what each option does:  - `--recursive`: Enables recursive downloading (following links) - `--level=3`: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL - `--no-parent`: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory - `--convert-links`: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally - `--adjust-extension`: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types - `--compression=auto`: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate) - `--accept html,htm`: Only downloads files with these extensions - `--directory-prefix=./ds`: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory  [wget2](https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2) is a better version of `wget` and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same.  ```bash wget2 \\   --recursive \\   --level=3 \\   --no-parent \\   --convert-links \\   --adjust-extension \\   --compression=auto \\   --accept html,htm \\   --directory-prefix=./ds \\   https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ```  There are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget:  ### Wpull  [Wpull](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) is a wget\u2010compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration.  ```bash uvx wpull \\   --recursive \\   --level=3 \\   --no-parent \\   --convert-links \\   --adjust-extension \\   --compression=auto \\   --accept html,htm \\   --directory-prefix=./ds \\   https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ```  ### HTTrack  [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) is dedicated website\u2010mirroring tool with rich filtering and link\u2010conversion options.  ```bash httrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\   -O \"./ds\" \\   \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\   -r3 ```  ### Robots.txt  `robots.txt` is a standard file found in a website's root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It's part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.  **Why it's important**:  - **Server load protection**: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers - **Privacy protection**: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed - **Legal compliance**: Respects website owners' rights to control access to their content - **Ethical web citizenship**: Shows respect for website administrators' wishes  **How to override robots.txt restrictions**:  - **wget, wget2**: Use `-e robots=off` - **httrack**: Use `-s0` - **wpull**: Use `--no-robots`  **When to override robots.txt (use with discretion)**:  Only bypass `robots.txt` when:  - You have explicit permission from the website owner - You're crawling your own website - The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won't cause server issues - You're conducting authorized security testing  Remember that bypassing `robots.txt` without legitimate reason may:  - Violate terms of service - Lead to IP banning - Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions - Cause reputation damage to your organization  Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Css Selectors", "filename": "css-selectors.md", "content": "## CSS Selectors  CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page.

Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way\u2014you download the data. 2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. 3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.  In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library.

Here's a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image.  ```dockerfile FROM python:3.11-slim # Set working directory WORKDIR /app # Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine, # but here we're just using a simple script. RUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py # Run the script CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"] ```  To build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:  ```bash # Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login podman login docker.io  # Build and run the container podman build -t py-hello . podman run -it py-hello  # Push the container to Docker Hub.

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.  This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:  1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query. 2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories. 3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters. 4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.  You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.  | Feature     | Local Models               | API                       | | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | | **Privacy** | High                       | Dependent on provider     | | **Cost**    | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go             | | **Scale**   | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | **Quality** | Varies by model            | Typically high            |  The [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:  1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality. 2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input. 5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.  ### Local Embeddings  [![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)  Here's a minimal example using a local embedding model:  ```python # /// script # requires-python = \"==3.12\" # dependencies = [ #   \"sentence-transformers\", #   \"httpx\", #   \"numpy\", # ] # ///  from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import numpy as np  model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model  async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:     \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"     return model.encode(text).tolist()  async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:     \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"     emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))     emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))     return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))  async def main():     print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))     print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))   if __name__ == \"__main__\":     import asyncio     asyncio.run(main()) ```  Note the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.  ### OpenAI Embeddings  For comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script:  ```python import os import httpx  async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:     \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"     async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:         response = await client.post(             \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\",             headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"},             json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text}         )         return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"] ```  **NOTE**: You need to set the [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable for this to work."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Extracting Audio And Transcripts", "filename": "extracting-audio-and-transcripts.md", "content": "## Extracting Audio and Transcripts  ## Media Processing: FFmpeg  [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is the standard command-line tool for processing video and audio files.

It's particularly useful for extracting audio and transcripts from videos.  Install using your package manager:  ```bash # macOS brew install yt-dlp  # Linux curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp chmod a+rx ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp  # Windows winget install yt-dlp ```  Common operations for extracting audio and transcripts:  ```bash # Download audio only at lowest quality suitable for speech yt-dlp -f \"ba[abr=3.9\" # dependencies = [\"yt-dlp\"] # ///  import yt_dlp  def download_audio(url: str) -> None:     \"\"\"Download audio at speech-optimized quality.\"\"\"     ydl_opts = {         'format': 'ba[abr<50]/worstaudio',         'postprocessors': [{             'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',             'preferredcodec': 'mp3',             'preferredquality': '32'         }]     }      with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:         ydl.download([url])  # Example usage download_audio('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID') ```  Tools:  - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): Required for audio extraction and conversion - [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper): Can be used with yt-dlp for speech-to-text - [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl): Alternative for image-focused sites  Note: Always respect copyright and terms of service when downloading content.  ## Whisper transcription  [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) is a highly optimized implementation of OpenAI's [Whisper model](https://github.com/openai/whisper), offering up to 4x faster transcription while using less memory.  You can install it via:  - `pip install faster-whisper` - [Download Windows Standalone](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases)  Here's a basic usage example:  ```bash faster-whisper-xxl \"video.mp4\" --model medium --language en ```  Here's my recommendation for transcribing videos. This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory.  ```bash faster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \\                    --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \\                    --model medium --language en $FILE ```  - `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from:   - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate   - `base`: Good for simple audio   - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy   - `medium`: Recommended default   - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest - `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from:   - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc.   - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example.   - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format.   - `txt`: Just the text transcript - `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is - `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.  Run `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options.  ## Gemini transcription  The [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:  1. They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. 2. They can handle audio input.  This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.  LLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:  1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. 4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.  Here's how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.  1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio. 2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key. 3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. 4. Run this code:    ```bash    curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\      -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\      -d \"$(cat << EOF    {      \"contents\": [        {          \"role\": \"user\",          \"parts\": [            {              \"inline_data\": {                \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\",                \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\"              }            },            {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"}          ]        }      ]    }    EOF    )\"    ```"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Fastapi", "filename": "fastapi.md", "content": "## Web Framework: FastAPI  [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern Python web framework for building APIs with automatic interactive documentation.

See the [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas).  Here's an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting:  ```python MEETING_TOOL = {     \"type\": \"function\",     \"function\": {         \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\",         \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\",         \"parameters\": {             \"type\": \"object\",             \"properties\": {                 \"date\": {                     \"type\": \"string\",                     \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\"                 },                 \"time\": {                     \"type\": \"string\",                     \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\"                 },                 \"meeting_room\": {                     \"type\": \"string\",                     \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\"                 }             },             \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"],             \"additionalProperties\": False         },         \"strict\": True     } } ```  ### How to define multiple functions  You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter.  Here's an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:  ```python tools = [     {         \"type\": \"function\",         \"function\": {             \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\",             \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\",             \"parameters\": {                 \"type\": \"object\",                 \"properties\": {                     \"employee_id\": {                         \"type\": \"integer\",                         \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"                     }                 },                 \"required\": [\"employee_id\"],                 \"additionalProperties\": False             },             \"strict\": True         }     },     {         \"type\": \"function\",         \"function\": {             \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\",             \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\",             \"parameters\": {                 \"type\": \"object\",                 \"properties\": {                     \"employee_id\": {                         \"type\": \"integer\",                         \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"                     },                     \"current_year\": {                         \"type\": \"integer\",                         \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\"                     }                 },                 \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"],                 \"additionalProperties\": False             },             \"strict\": True         }     } ] ```  Best Practices:  1. **Use Strict Mode**    - Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls    - Define all required parameters    - Set `additionalProperties: False` 2. **Use tool choice**    - Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools    - The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate 3. **Clear Descriptions**    - Write detailed function and parameter descriptions    - Include expected formats and units    - Mention any constraints or limitations 4. **Error Handling**    - Validate function inputs before execution    - Return clear error messages    - Handle missing or invalid parameters"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Geospatial Analysis With Excel", "filename": "geospatial-analysis-with-excel.md", "content": "## Geospatial Analysis with Excel  [![Geospatial analysis with Excel](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/49LjxNvxyVs/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/49LjxNvxyVs)  You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:  - **Data Collection**: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources. - **Data Processing**: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps. - **Map Creation**: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact. - **Visualization**: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively. - **Storytelling**: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.

[![\ud83d\udd25 Python FastAPI Google Login Tutorial | OAuth2 Authentication (19 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4ExQYRCwbzw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4ExQYRCwbzw)  Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because:  - It's popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts. - It's secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication.  Here's how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user.  1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console \u2013 Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**. 2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`). 3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a `.env` file:     ```env    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret    ```  4. Create your FastAPI `app.py`:  ```python # /// script # dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"] # ///  import os from dotenv import load_dotenv from fastapi import FastAPI, Request from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth  load_dotenv() app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\")  oauth = OAuth() oauth.register(     name=\"google\",     client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"),     client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"),     server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\",     client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"}, )  @app.get(\"/\") async def application(request: Request):     user = request.session.get(\"user\")     # 3. For authenticated users: say hello     if user:         return f\"Hello {user['email']}\"     # 2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session     if \"code\" in request.query_params:         token = await oauth.google.authorize_access_token(request)         request.session[\"user\"] = token[\"userinfo\"]         return RedirectResponse(\"/\")     # 1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login     return await oauth.google.authorize_redirect(request, request.url)  if __name__ == \"__main__\":     import uvicorn     uvicorn.run(app, port=8000) ```  Now, run `uv run app.py`.  1. When you visit  you'll be redirected to a Google login page. 2. When you log in, you'll be redirected back to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Now you'll see the email ID you logged in with.

By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.  Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line.  ### Install and run TypeSense  [Install TypeSense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html).  ```bash mkdir typesense-data  docker run -p 8108:8108 \\   -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\   --data-dir /data \\   --api-key=secret-key \\   --enable-cors ```  - **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108   - `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port.   - `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence.   - `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume.   - `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API.   - `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests.  **Expected output:**  - Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`. - Listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8108`.  ### Embed and import documents into TypeSense  Follow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](rag-cli.md) tutorial to create a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.  [TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We'll use that capability.  Save the following as `addnotes.py` and run it with `uv run addnotes.py`.  ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.13\" # dependencies = [\"httpx\"] # /// import json import httpx import os  headers = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"}  schema = {     \"name\": \"notes\",     \"fields\": [         {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},         {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},         {             \"name\": \"embedding\",             \"type\": \"float[]\",             \"embed\": {                 \"from\": [\"content\"],                 \"model_config\": {                     \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\",                     \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),                 },             },         },     ], }  with open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f:     chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]  with httpx.Client() as client:     # Create the collection     if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404:         r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers)      # Embed the chunks     result = client.post(         \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\",         headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"},         data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),     )     print(result.text) ```  - **`httpx.Client`**: an HTTP client for Python. - **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI. - **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. - **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence. - **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection. - **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.  **Expected output:**  - A JSON summary string like `{\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported. - (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)  ### 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question  Now, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search):  ```bash Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"  payload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\   '{      searches: [        {          collection: $coll,          q:           $q,          query_by:    \"content,embedding\",          sort_by:     \"_text_match:desc\",          prefix:      false,          exclude_fields: \"embedding\"        }      ]    }' ) curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\   -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\   -d \"$payload\" \\   | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\   | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\   | uvx streamdown ```  - **`query_by: \"content,embedding\"`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity. - **`sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\"`**: boosts exact text hits. - **`exclude_fields: \"embedding\"`**: keeps responses lightweight. - **`curl -d`**: posts the search request. - **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit\u2019s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) - **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer.  **Expected output:**  - The raw matched snippets printed first. - Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Image Compression", "filename": "image-compression.md", "content": "## Images: Compression  Image compression is essential when deploying apps.

You should be able to see them on YouTube.  **Q2: How should I approach TDS?**  **A2:** The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools.  **Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?**  **A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.  **Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?**  **A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.  **Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?**  **A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.  **Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?**  **A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.  **Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?**  **A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.  **Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?**  **A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.  **Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?**  **A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.  **Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?**  **A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.  **Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?**  **A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.  **Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?**  **A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.  **Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?**  **A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.  **Q14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?**  **A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions.  **Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?**  **A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.  **Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?**  **A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube.  **Q17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?**  **A17:** Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people.  **Q18: What is a \"take-home open internet\" project?**  **A18:** You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions.  **Q19: What weeks are relevant to each project?**  **A19:** Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics.  **Q20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?**  **A20:** If you can solve the problems, that's good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 16", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-16.md", "content": "# Live Session: 16 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-16 Week 1 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1H5Aq7HjqwQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/1H5Aq7HjqwQ)  **Q1: What will be covered in this session?**  **A1:** This session will cover concepts from Week 1 of the graded assignment in Tools in Data Science (TDS). The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session.  **Q2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?**  **A2:** The instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube.  **Q3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What's involved?**  **A3:** The question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question.  **Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?**  **A4:** UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup.  **Q5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?**  **A5:** There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js.  **Q6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?**  **A6:** No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission.  **Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?**  **A7:** The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material.  **Q8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?**  **A8:** Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided.  **Q9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?**  **A9:** UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments.  **Q10: How do we start the project?**  **A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project.  **Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?**  **A11:** Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube.  **Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?**  **A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute).  **Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?**  **A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser.  **Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?**  **A14:** The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors.  **Q15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?**  **A15:** The Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server.  **Q16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?**  **A16:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab.  **Q17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?**  **A17:** The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files.  **Q18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?**  **A18:** The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure.  **Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?**  **A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs).  **Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?**  **A20:** The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. `innerText` gives the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` gives the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction.  **Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides `innerText`?**  **A21:** Yes, there are other attributes. `text` is similar to `innerText`, but `innerText` is more reliable. Always use `innerText` if `text` doesn't work.  **Q22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?**  **A22:** Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#).  **Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?**  **A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array.  **Q24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?**  **A24:** Enclose the code in a `copy()` function. This copies the output to your clipboard.  **Q25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?**  **A25:** It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option.  **Q26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?**  **A26:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change.  **Q27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?**  **A27:** Classes allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element.  **Q28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?**  **A28:** No, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements.  **Q29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?**  **A29:** The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question.  **Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?**  **A30:** The syntax was `$$(\".className\").map(...)`. The `$$` selects elements with the specified class, and `map` iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`. `innerText` returns only the text, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. If `text` doesn't work, use `innerText`.  **Q31: Should the `innerText` be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?**  **A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears.  **Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?**  **A32:** npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It's an alternative to npm, which installs globally.  **Q33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?**  **A33:** npx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file.  **Q34: While showing `innerText`, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?**  **A34:** That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability.  **Q35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?**  **A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard.  **Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?**  **A36:** For the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun with them."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 17", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-17.md", "content": "# Live Session: 17 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-17 Week1 - Session 2 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/hG5WqtbpfkI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/hG5WqtbpfkI)  **Q1: How to solve question number 7 (counting Wednesdays between two dates)?**  **A1:** Use Excel. Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed.  **Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?**  **A2:** Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient.  **Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?**  **A3:** This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question.  **Q4: What is JSON and how is it used?**  **A4:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles.  **Q5: How can I access data from a JSON object?**  **A5:** The instructor shows how to access elements within a JSON object using indexing in Python. For example, to access the name of the third student in a list, you would use `students[2][name]`. JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values.  **Q6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)?**  **A6:** Websites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched.  **Q7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL?**  **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using the `requests` library in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response.  **Q8: What is Postman and how does it work?**  **A8:** Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose.  **Q9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?**  **A9:** The instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (`>`) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail.  **Q10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?**  **A10:** For large datasets, copying and pasting is impractical. Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation.  **Q11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?**  **A11:** When opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the `encoding` parameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding.  **Q12: How to use Git and GitHub?**  **A12:** The instructor suggests covering Git and GitHub in a separate session due to the complexity and time required for a thorough explanation.  **Q13: How to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in VS Code?**  **A13:** The instructor explains how to use the WSL extension in VS Code to access a Linux terminal within VS Code. This is useful for running bash commands. The instructor notes that the default terminal in a Mac might not support all commands, so WSL is an alternative.  **Q14: Why does the course feel overwhelming?**  **A14:** The instructor acknowledges that the course challenges students' logical thinking by introducing concepts and tools not previously taught. The instructor encourages students to use ChatGPT to help bridge knowledge gaps and emphasizes that the course aims to build a strong foundation and encourage exploration beyond the curriculum. The instructor also points out that the course materials are available in the course portal, including content for weeks beyond the current one. A feedback form is provided for students to report challenges and suggest improvements."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 20", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-20.md", "content": "# Live Session: 20 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-20 Week 2 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aJnygTpma7M/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/aJnygTpma7M)  **Q1: What is an ML project, and how does it compare to the \"fitting of six models\" project?**  **A1:** An ML (Machine Learning) project involves more factors than just fitting models. The \"fitting of six models\" project was a simplified version done for a friend's certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning.  **Q2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?**  **A2:** The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.  **Q3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?**  **A3:** The TDS project has three main parts:  1. **GitHub:** For version control and code storage. 2. **Docker Hub:** For containerizing and deploying the application. 3. **LLM (Large Language Model):** For the core functionality of the application.    The project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details.  **Q4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?**  **A4:** The course aims to equip all participants, regardless of their background, with the necessary skills for the industry. It provides support through live sessions, encourages the use of external resources like ChatGPT and YouTube, and offers dedicated project sessions. The goal is to bridge the technical gap and prepare everyone for real-world challenges.  **Q5: How can I seek help or clarification on the project, especially if I find it overwhelming?**  **A5:** You can ask questions during the live sessions, utilize the course forum, or reach out to the instructors directly through the designated channels. Additionally, you can use resources like ChatGPT for assistance.  **Q6: What are the key tools and technologies used in the TDS project?**  **A6:** Key tools include Git for version control, GitHub for code hosting, Docker for containerization, Podman for running Docker images, and Fast API (or similar frameworks) for creating the application.  **Q7: How can I use VS Code for managing my Git repository?**  **A7:** VS Code has extensions that simplify Git operations. You can initialize a new Git instance, connect it to a remote GitHub repository, commit changes with messages, and manage branches all within the VS Code interface.  **Q8: How can I handle case-insensitive replacements in files using command-line tools?**  **A8:** You can use the `sed` editor with the `-i` option for in-place editing and the `I` flag for case-insensitive matching. You can combine this with `find` to locate and modify multiple files within a directory structure.  **Q9: How do I set up the connection between my local Git instance and a remote GitHub repository?**  **A9:** You can use the `git remote add origin ` command to establish the connection. You can find the specific URL on the GitHub repository page.  **Q10: What if I encounter issues while trying to push changes to GitHub?**  **A10:** If you're using HTTPS, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password for authentication. If you encounter errors, ensure you have configured your Git username and email correctly using `git config`. You might also need to check the permissions granted to your personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.  **Q11: How many students are regularly attending the live sessions?**  **A11:** The attendance in the live sessions is lower than expected, with around 15-25 students at peak times, compared to the 400-500 enrolled in the current term.  **Q12: What is the new feature added for TDS live sessions?**  **A12:** A new feature has been added that curates the live sessions into a few important portions, providing a summary of the questions asked and their answers. This allows students who missed a session to quickly catch up on the key topics discussed.  **Q13: When is the next session scheduled, and will it clash with college classes?**  **A13:** The next session is scheduled for 5 PM. There might be clashes with college classes, as the schedule is pre-planned with classes on Tuesdays from 5-7 PM, Wednesdays from 9-10 AM, and other classes from 8-10 PM.  **Q14: Where can I find the link for the new feature summarizing live sessions?**  **A14:** The link has been emailed to all participants and can also be found at the very bottom of the course page.  **Q15: How can I get support regarding any particular topic in the project?**  **A15:** You can use the \"Learning Feedback\" form on the portal to submit your queries related to specific modules or topics. The responses are used to plan future sessions.  **Q16: What is GitHub, and how is it used in the project?**  **A16:** GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows for version control, collaboration, and code sharing. In the project, you will push your code to a GitHub repository, making it accessible to others and enabling collaboration.  **Q17: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**  **A17:** Git is a version control system that you install and use on your local machine, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing for remote collaboration and code sharing.  **Q18: What are the alternatives to using command-line tools for Git and GitHub operations?**  **A18:** You can use a graphical interface like VS Code with Git extensions to manage your Git repositories and interact with GitHub. This can be more user-friendly than using command-line tools.  **Q19: How does the `sed` editor work for replacing text in files?**  **A19:** The `sed` editor is a stream editor that can perform text transformations on input streams. You can use it with the `s` command for substitution, specifying the pattern to match and the replacement text. The `g` flag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the `I` flag enables case-insensitive matching.  **Q1: How can I use the `find` command to locate files for processing with `sed`?**  **A21:** The `find` command can locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, and location. You can use the `-exec` option to execute a command, like `sed`, on each file found. For example, `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/IITM/IIT Madras/gI' {} \\;` will find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and replace \"IITM\" with \"IIT Madras\" (case-insensitive) in each file.  **Q22: Why am I getting an \"authentication failed\" error when pushing to GitHub?**  **A22:** This could be because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.  **Q23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?**  **A23:** You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under \"Developer settings.\" When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password.  **Q24: How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub authentication?**  **A24:** You can generate SSH keys using the `ssh-keygen` command and then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. This allows you to authenticate without using a password or personal access token.  **Q25: What is the purpose of the `git remote add origin` command?**  **A25:** This command adds a remote repository named \"origin\" to your local Git instance. \"Origin\" is a conventional name for the primary remote repository, and the URL specifies the location of the remote repository on GitHub.  **Q26: How can I update the remote URL if I have already added one?**  **A26:** You can update the remote URL using the `git remote set-url origin ` command, replacing `` with the correct URL of your GitHub repository.  **Q27: What is the difference between committing and pushing in Git?**  **A27:** Committing saves changes to your local Git instance, while pushing uploads those committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.  **Q28: How can I use VS Code to simplify Git operations?**  **A28:** VS Code has built-in Git integration and extensions that provide a graphical interface for managing your repository. You can stage changes, commit them with messages, push to remote repositories, manage branches, and perform other Git operations without using the command line.  **Q29: What is the significance of the `.git` folder in my project directory?**  **A29:** The `.git` folder is a hidden directory that contains all the information related to your Git instance, including the history of commits, branches, and other metadata. It's essential for version control and should not be modified directly.  **Q30: How can I ensure that my code is backed up and accessible to collaborators?**  **A30:** By pushing your code to a remote GitHub repository, you create a backup of your project and make it accessible to collaborators who have been granted access. This ensures that your code is safe even if your local machine encounters issues."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 21", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-21.md", "content": "# Live Session: 21 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-21 Week 2 - Session 2 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/0e0RhXREnxU/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/0e0RhXREnxU)  **Q1: How much depth of knowledge is needed for the tools in the TDS course, specifically for GA1 and GA2?**  **A1:** The goal is to give you sufficient proficiency to execute the purpose of the tools, not to make you an expert. The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle.  **Q2: What is the tool to create the API?**  **A2:** FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session.  **Q3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?**  **A3:** Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today.  **Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?**  **A4:** NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time.  **Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?**  **A5:** You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub.  **Q6: What is the tool to create the API?**  **A6:** FastAPI.  **Q7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?**  **A7:** Whatever you last submitted is your final score.  **Q8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don't submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?**  **A8:** This will be addressed toward the end of the session.  **Q9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?**  **A9:** Most web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won't work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box.  **Q10: What is CI/CD?**  **A10:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it. This is useful in data science when pulling data from various places and quickly integrating findings into a workflow.  **Q11: What is Vercel?**  **A11:** Vercel is a platform to deploy applications. You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo.  **Q12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?**  **A12:** Docker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos.  **Q13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?**  **A13:** Yes, that's possible.  **Q14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?**  **A14:** There will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week. This session will show how all the tools fit together.  **Q15: If someone goes through CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and REST API, will that cover 50% of the course?**  **A15:** Yes, roughly. The core technologies (REST APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) haven't changed much in 30 years. Learning these will give you a foundation to learn other tools more easily. The course will also spend significant time on LLMs and how they fit into the workflow."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 22", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-22.md", "content": "# Live Session: 22 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-22 Week 2 - Session 3 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/QnLi-C_LiXk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/QnLi-C_LiXk)  **Q1: What are the essential base technologies to learn for the TDS course?**  **A1:** Focus on these three areas: 1) Bash and shell scripting; 2) Git; 3) CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.  **Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?**  **A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.  **Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?**  **A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.  **Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?**  **A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.  **Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?**  **A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging.  **Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?**  **A6:** Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause.  **Q7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?**  **A7:** All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet.  **Q8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?**  **A8:** GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email.  **Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?**  **A9:** There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes.  **Q10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: \"Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original.\" I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong?**  **A10:** The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared.  **Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?**  **A11:** The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses.  **Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?**  **A12:** No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.  **Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?**  **A13:** Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.  **Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?**  **A14:** You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The `diff` command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.  **Q15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I've tried using ChatGPT. What's wrong?**  **A15:** The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 23", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-23.md", "content": "# Live Session: 23 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-23 Week 3 - Session 4 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/TxGY540ru3A/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/TxGY540ru3A)  **Q1: How can I compare two files using the command line?**  **A1:** You can use the `diff` command in bash, or the `git diff` command if you've initialized a git repository. The `diff` command shows the differences between two files directly. `git diff` compares commits in a git repository.  **Q2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help?**  **A2:** Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot.  **Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?**  **A3:** I used a bash script that combines the `find` command (to locate files of a specific type, like `.txt` files) and the `mv` command (to move them). The `find` command searches the current directory (`./`) for files (`-type f`) and the `-exec` option executes the `mv` command on each file found. The curly braces `{}` are placeholders for the filenames.  **Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?**  **A4:** You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We're not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries.  **Q5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?**  **A5:** First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using `python -m venv `. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`). Install Flask using `pip install flask`. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a `vercel.json` file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).  **Q6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?**  **A6:** When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn't matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove `debug=True` from your Flask application before deploying to production.  **Q7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?**  **A7:** ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn't need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator.  **Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?**  **A8:** ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.  **Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?**  **A9:** A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages.  **Q10: What is the assignment?**  **A10:** Create a Flask application that takes a user's birth month as input and returns their zodiac sign. This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link. Remember to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 28", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-28.md", "content": "# Live Session: 28 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-28 Week 3 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lmSMQ5LWa30/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/lmSMQ5LWa30)  **Q1: Can I ask a question about the graded assignment for week one?**  **A1:** I'll try to answer it at the end of the session if there's time. We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session.  **Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?**  **A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later.  **Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?**  **A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.  **Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**  **A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.  **Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?**  **A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file.  **Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?**  **A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section.  **Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?**  **A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.  **Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?**  **A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.  **Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?**  **A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done.  **Q10: What's required for grading?**  **A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria:  - It must exist and be publicly accessible. - It must have a license file (MIT license). - It must have a valid Dockerfile. - The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command. - The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository.  It doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated.  **Q11: What is the grading scheme?**  **A11:** Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12.  **Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?**  **A12:** No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code.  **Q13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?**  **A13:** You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code.  **Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?**  **A14:** All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register.  **Q15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do?**  **A15:** We'll cover this in a later session.  **Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?**  **A16:** We'll cover this in a later session.  **Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?**  **A17:** Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We'll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow.  **Q18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?**  **A18:** Yes, we'll provide support. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.  **Q19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?**  **A19:** Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.  **Q20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**  **A20:** Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.  **Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?**  **A21:** You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.  **Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?**  **A22:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.  **Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?**  **A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.  **Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?**  **A24:** The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens.  **Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?**  **A25:** No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work.  **Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?**  **A26:** No, you don't have to pay.  **Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?**  **A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due.  **Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?**  **A28:** Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then.  **Q29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?**  **A29:** Sure.  **Q30: I submitted my answers, but I don't know if I did it correctly. There's nothing to submit here. I just say \"yes\"?**  **A30:** You just say \"yes\" and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.  **Q31: Why isn't it reflecting?**  **A31:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.  **Q32: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**  **A32:** For question 10, you need to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.  **Q33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?**  **A33:** Before I talk about those, let's start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs.  **Q34: How do I get my API key?**  **A34:** You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs.  **Q35: What is a proxy?**  **A35:** OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI.  **Q36: How many tokens does a prompt take?**  **A36:** The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage.  **Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?**  **A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient.  **Q38: How are API calls made?**  **A38:** You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output.  **Q39: Can you share the notebook file?**  **A39:** No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available.  **Q40: What about function calling?**  **A40:** We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate.  **Q41: What about embeddings?**  **A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session.  **Q42: What about text extraction?**  **A42:** We'll cover this in a future session.  **Q43: What about Base64 encoding?**  **A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API.  **Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?**  **A44:** Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session.  **Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?**  **A45:** Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples.  **Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.**  **A46:** The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I'll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 29", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-29.md", "content": "# Live Session: 29 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-29 Week 3 - Session 2 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/EPiVIP97fzI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/EPiVIP97fzI)  **Q1: I am a student, and I joined the session without using my IITM ID. How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?**  **A1:** You need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don't allow anyone to join without their IITM ID.  **Q2: Today's session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven't seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I've solved them?**  **A2:** Tomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won't be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic.  **Q3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?**  **A3:** No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday.  **Q4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I'll ask then.**  **A4:** That would be great.  **Q5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn't sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.**  **A5:** I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks.  **Q6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?**  **A6:** Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.)  **Q7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?**  **A7:** Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending `/api` to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital 'F' in `Flask` in the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.)  **Q8: In the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?**  **A8:** Regarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital 'F' for Flask, but I think it won't install because... I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used `http.server`. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses `http.server`. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate `requirements.txt` file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says `class` (CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response.  **Q9: I'm getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)**  **A9:** Please close the picture-in-picture; it won't disconnect the session. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.)  **Q10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**  **A10:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.  **Q11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**  **A11:** There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse. It shouldn't give you a problem anymore.  **Q12: One more thing: in the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?**  **A12:** The issue is likely in your code's logic. You should try to fix the code. The word `class` itself is a keyword in Python, so you'll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called `class` (CLASSS) without the underscore.  **Q13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that. Should I run this first?**  **A13:** Before we do that, let's see what error comes out. You haven't put the actual correct URL, right? Just add `/api`. It's because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the `requests` module instead of the `curl` command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.  **Q14: In question 5, I've enabled it, but I'm getting an \"unexpected end of JSON input\" error. I'm not sure why. I've tried different structures for the JSON.**  **A14:** Copy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better. At the bottom, you have an extra required address and additional properties that are not necessary. That shouldn't cause it to be invalid JSON. Try without that. Just remove that extra bit and try without it.  **Q15: One more thing: in FastAPI question 9, I'm giving the URL, but it's giving me the whole data. Even when I add conditions, it shows the whole data. I'll show you. Should I run this first?**  **A15:** Add `/api` at the end of that. That's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There's some logic error. You're getting a Cloudflare error. That's something to do with the CDN service giving some sort of response. We'll have to check with Anand.  **Q16: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly earlier, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**  **A16:** At the moment, it's working, right? There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse.  **Q17: I'm getting an error from this. I don't know how...**  **A17:** In the ninth question, you're getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You'll need to... this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse.  **Q18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I'm not... while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**  **A18:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.  **Q19: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**  **A19:** It looks like a Cloudflare error. I've noted this error. It is from Cloudflare. You could just try again. When did you try this, apart from just now? You got the same error yesterday as well? Yeah, so that's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There is some logic error.  **Q20: Should I install it separately?**  **A20:** No, you won't require requirements for it. Vercel is able to run the program without that.  **Q21: For Vercel, I will take the example code and try to run it. One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that.**  **A21:** You should use the requests module and send a request using headers and all those informations. What you are using is actually OpenAI's own library, and that will not work. You will have to use the requests module and send the request just like the examples shown. There will be a URL, a header, and a payload. If you use their own library, it will not construct it correctly. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.  **Q22: This was in ROE last term. I'm getting an error. How?**  **A22:** This was a really fascinating question. There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well.  **Q23: Can I get the code for this?**  **A23:** He will... didn't he provide that in a Discourse post? Someone has pasted it on Discourse. If not, we can always ask him to provide it.  **Q24: I've taken one more course, something on business BA or something like that. There is no GA at all for this. There is a GA, but you don't submit here. These two courses are somewhat different.**  **A24:** Right, right.  **Q25: When I joined (late), an ngrok error was being shown by someone. I'm also getting a very similar error. I couldn't follow the discussion at all. I joined towards the end. Shall I share my screen?**  **A25:** Just before you share your screen, was it giving you a Cloudflare error? (The student describes the error.) You can share your screen. I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it's still giving an error. The instructor then suggests using the directly executable file for ngrok.)  **Q26: I tried all this, same issue. I'm getting an error. I think I've tried all this, same issue.**  **A26:** The account is limited to one simultaneous session. You've got another session running somewhere. I think that is inside VS WSL. You'll have to stop that. You'll have to check for that. The output that your code is generating is wrong. It's generating null, null, which is wrong. Just try to check for... can you go back to the question once? It is sending some URL-encoded parameter. There might be a mistake while reading those parameters. Just changing that code will help. There's a problem with my code where it's fetching null for all the data, which it should not. You can either ask on Discourse or try to fix it yourself."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 30", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-30.md", "content": "# Live Session: 30 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-30 Week 3 - Session 3 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/6VfrL5b8lLc/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/6VfrL5b8lLc)  **Q1: My screen is visible?**  **A1:** Yes, your screen is visible.  **Q2: I posted on Discourse and emailed you about a problem deploying a Flask application on Vercel. The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?**  **A2:** The error likely stems from your `requirements.txt` file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a `requirements.txt` file without manually typing it.  **Q3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.**  **A3:** Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one.  **Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?**  **A4:** Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the `requirements.txt` file. You can use a single-line command in Python: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment).  **Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI.**  **A5:** Let's try `python -m venv venv` in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library.  **Q6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?**  **A6:** No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign.  **Q7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.**  **A7:** I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API.  **Q8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).**  **A8:** I'm just demonstrating how to create the `requirements.txt` file.  **Q9: If I'm running a virtual environment with `uv`, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?**  **A9:** Exactly. That's a downside of `uv`. When using `uv`, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won't be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won't be in your `requirements.txt` file. For minor projects that you don't need to deploy, `uv` is fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there.  **Q10: Now it's showing nothing. I don't know why.**  **A10:** Your server is not running. Run `vercel deploy --prod` again. I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code.  **Q11: I'm using httpx.**  **A11:** Yesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That's why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the `requirements.txt` file and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it's showing blank. Can you show me the code?  **Q12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it's showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add `/api` to the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.**  **A12:** That's what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You're using CORS. You've used a lot of complexity; you've made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It's not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let's go to line 5 of your code. Add `../` before `q` to include the parent directory. Save and redeploy.  **Q13: Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy?**  **A13:** No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.  **Q14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?**  **A14:** No, they are in the `vercel-python/api` directory.  **Q15: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name in question 9.**  **A15:** `class` is a keyword in Python. You can't use it as a variable name. I'll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I'll explain what that means.  **Q16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?**  **A16:** You need to use lists. Import `List` from the `typing` library. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is `className`, but we can use the `class` parameter using this alias.  **Q17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don't know how to write it.**  **A17:** You are using `httpx`. You're also using `index.py`. This is not Flask-based; it's more like an HTTP server.  **Q18: I'll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I'll share my screen.**  **A18:** Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here.  **Q19: I'm confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.**  **A19:** Can you open Vercel again? Yesterday, was this particular box showing \"Not Found\"? When you added `/api` to the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure.  **Q20: I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.**  **A20:** Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy? No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.  **Q21: Show your folder structure.**  **A21:** I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.  **Q22: If I use `uv`, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?**  **A22:** Yes.  **Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?**  **A23:** I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git.  **Q24: Can we use the query function?**  **A24:** Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi.  **Q25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?**  **A25:** That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values. `values` will return this.  **Q26: Question 9: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name.**  **A26:** `class` is a keyword. You can't use it as a variable name. Create a different variable name. I used an alias.  **Q27: Question 6: Can you take the last of the class now, or should I wait?**  **A27:** Let's arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I'll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me.  **Q28: Can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?**  **A28:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. `httpie` is a command-line tool, not a Python module. I'm not sure about `httpie`.  **Q29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**  **A29:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`.  **Q30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?**  **A30:** You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array.  **Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?**  **A31:** Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face.  **Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**  **A32:** I think it's been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS.  **Q33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?**  **A33:** Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\".  **Q34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**  **A34:** I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course.  **Q35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.**  **A35:** It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD.  **Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?**  **A36:** You can try. It should work. Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work.  **Q37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?**  **A37:** I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle.  **Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**  **A38:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`.  **Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?**  **A39:** We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only.  **Q40: My first doubt is, can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?**  **A40:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. I'm not sure about `httpie`. It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. `requests` is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the `requests` module.  **Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?**  **A41:** That's the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we're representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape.  **Q42: Does it involve SVD?**  **A42:** I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion.  **Q43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten. You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.**  **A43:** You would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between \"bicycle\" and \"cycle\" would be higher than between \"bicycle\" and \"apple\". That's how computers store this information."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 01 31", "filename": "live-session-2025-01-31.md", "content": "# Live Session: 31 Jan 2025  [![2025-01-31 Week 3 - Session 4 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sdg4N-H4BR0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sdg4N-H4BR0)  **Q1: In today's session, what will be covered?**  **A1:** We will be discussing the function calling part of OpenAI. We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function.  **Q2: What is the first step in the process?**  **A2:** First, we import the `requests` library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request.  **Q3: What is the goal of the program?**  **A3:** The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders.  **Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?**  **A4:** The program will send the user's prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format.  **Q5: What are the predefined functions?**  **A5:** The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include `get_weather_info` (which takes a location as a parameter) and `best_hotels` (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt.  **Q6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?**  **A6:** OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format.  **Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?**  **A7:** Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.  **Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?**  **A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells.  **Q9: How is the JSON response handled?**  **A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function.  **Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?**  **A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data.  **Q11: How can we integrate a voice model?**  **A11:** You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application.  **Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?**  **A12:** We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image.  **Q13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?**  **A13:** Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.  **Q14: What if the `order` function doesn't work as expected?**  **A14:** The instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using `json.loads` to convert strings to JSON objects.  **Q15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?**  **A15:** The ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. It's recommended to save your work frequently.  **Q16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?**  **A16:** The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters.  **Q17: How do we handle the `UUID` generation to ensure uniqueness?**  **A17:** The `UUID` library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation.  **Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?**  **A18:** Instead of using absolute paths (`os.path`), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys.  **Q19: What is the overall approach to building this application?**  **A19:** The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding how to parse JSON responses and handle errors."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 02 01", "filename": "live-session-2025-02-01.md", "content": "# Live Session: 01 Feb 2025  [![2025-02-01 Week 3 - Session 5 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tsn7B7mDzw8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/tsn7B7mDzw8)  **Q1: Can I use Python notebooks instead of VS Code for this project?**  **A1:** You can use Python notebooks for interactive development and debugging, but for a production environment, a script file (.py) is better because it allows for a defined order of execution, unlike notebooks where code cells may not necessarily branch from one section to another. Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step.  **Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?**  **A2:** That's a good question. This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors.  **Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?**  **A3:** Use `uv`. `uv` is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and `uv` handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions.  **Q4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user's request?**  **A4:** You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function.  **Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`?**  **A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.  **Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?**  **A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling.  **Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?**  **A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.  **Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?**  **A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that:  - The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function. - The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time). - The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity). - You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`).  **Q9: How do I use Docker?**  **A9:** Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using `podman build -t tds-hello .` (the `.` refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using `podman run -it tds-hello bash`. The `bash` command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container.  **Q10: What are the use cases for Docker?**  **A10:** Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.  **Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?**  **A11:** The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You'll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 02 04", "filename": "live-session-2025-02-04.md", "content": "# Live Session: 04 Feb 2025  [![2025-02-04 Week 4 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8A7Z_PN_PzQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8A7Z_PN_PzQ)  **Q1: I'm having trouble with question 7 of the GA3 assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing \"method not allowed\".**  **A1:** When you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service.  **Q2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the \"method not allowed\" error. I don't know why.**  **A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client.  **Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?**  **A3:** Go to the \"Body\" section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces `{}`. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (...) from the copied JSON. Click the \"Send\" button.  **Q4: I'm getting an error: \"API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\" Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?**  **A4:** Yes, you are. Since you don't have a `.env` file, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with `return \"hello\"` to test. Restart the server.  **Q5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.**  **A5:** Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests).  **Q6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?**  **A6:** Recently.  **Q7: I'm still stuck. Can you spell \"Thunder Client\"?**  **A7:** T-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T  **Q8: I'm still getting errors. What's wrong?**  **A8:** Let's review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy.  **Q9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.**  **A9:** Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client.  **Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?**  **A10:** Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use `*`, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from `server1` and `server2`, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name.  **Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.**  **A11:** Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.  **Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.**  **A12:** Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python.  **Q13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?**  **A13:** In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine.  **Q14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**  **A14:** If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same.  **Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?**  **A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost.  **Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**  **A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes.  **Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?**  **A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process.  **Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).**  **A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming.  **Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?**  **A19:** That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.  **Q20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?**  **A20:** You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks.  **Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.**  **A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment.  **Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?**  **A22:** The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters.  **Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?**  **A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs.  **Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?**  **A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure.  **Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?**  **A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call.  **Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?**  **A26:** It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.  **Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?**  **A27:** The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.  **Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output?**  **A28:** The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module.  **Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?**  **A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.  **Q30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**  **A30:** You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify.  **Q31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out. Can we still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**  **A31:** Officially, no. However, reviewing your answers can still be beneficial for learning.  **Q32: Can you give me some hints on how to write a prompt to make the AI in question 9 say \"yes\"?**  **A32:** That's something you'll need to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 02 06", "filename": "live-session-2025-02-06.md", "content": "# Live Session: 06 Feb 2025  [![2025-02-06 Week 4 - Session 3 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/u5RFmePd7NQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/u5RFmePd7NQ)  **Q1: In this GA4 session, what's new compared to previous GAs?**  **A1:** The trajectory has moved from hard to easy. This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.  **Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?**  **A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.  **Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?**  **A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.  **Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?**  **A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).  **Q5: How does the `IMPORTHTML` function automatically find the table?**  **A5:** It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly.  **Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?**  **A6:** There are three ways:  - **Method 1:** If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly. - **Method 2:** Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID. - **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data.  **Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?**  **A7:** `innerText` returns only the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code within that element.  **Q8: I'm having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I've posted on Discourse multiple times, but it's still not working. The error is \"Method Not Allowed\".**  **A8:** When using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I'll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost).  **Q9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?**  **A9:** The scope is indeed broad. The project's requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He's busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing. The goal is to extract data, but the method is not specified. You can enhance the goal by using other tools (Autodesk, Blender, etc.), but the scope should be restricted by the QA team. We can discuss this further in a meeting."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Session 2025 02 07", "filename": "live-session-2025-02-07.md", "content": "# Live Session: 07 Feb 2025  [![2025-02-07 Week 4 - Session 4 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/SiW-rcMk0Nk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/SiW-rcMk0Nk)  **Q1: How difficult are the TDS assignments?**  **A1:** The first assignment was easy, the second was hard, the third was average, and the fourth seems easy. However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.  **Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?**  **A2:** It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.  **Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?**  **A3:** First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint.  **Q4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?**  **A4:** JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key.  **Q5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?**  **A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this.  **Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?**  **A6:** Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States).  **Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?**  **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between `find` and `findall` functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser.  **Q8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn't match?**  **A8:** If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don't match, it usually means there's an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values.  **Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?**  **A9:** The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method.  **Q10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?**  **A10:** Many websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., `page=2` for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages.  **Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?**  **A11:** Always check the website's terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond. Selenium is an alternative approach that simulates a browser, but it's more involved than Beautiful Soup. The instructor mentions being banned from Nominatim for sending too many requests in a short time frame.  **Q12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?**  **A12:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to extract product names, prices, and links from an Amazon search result page. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags and attributes (e.g., `span` elements with a specific class) and extract the text content. The instructor also shows how to convert string prices to numerical values. The instructor notes that the order of elements is preserved when using Beautiful Soup, ensuring that data is correctly associated."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Live Sessions", "filename": "live-sessions.md", "content": "# Live Sessions  Live sessions by the instructors and TAs are recorded and uploaded to YouTube.

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.  [![Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)  ### What Makes an Agent?  An LLM agent consists of three core components:  1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next 2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) 3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps  Agents operate through a loop:  - Observe the environment - Think about what to do - Take action using tools - Observe results - Repeat until task completion  ### Command-Line Agent Example  We've created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py \":ignore\") that:  1. Takes a task description from the command line 2. Generates code to accomplish the task 3. Automatically extracts and executes the code 4. Passes the results back to the LLM 5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails  Here's how it works:  ```bash uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\" ```  The agent will:  1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes 2. Execute the script in a subprocess 3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr) 4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation 5. Present a final answer to the user  Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow:  1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script 2. Code extraction from the LLM response 3. Code execution in a subprocess 4. Result interpretation by the LLM 5. Error handling and retry logic if needed  This demonstrates the core agent loop of:  - Planning (generating code) - Execution (running the code) - Reflection (interpreting results) - Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)  ### Agent Architectures  Different agent architectures exist for different use cases:  1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions 2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning 3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules 4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps  ### Real-World Applications  LLM agents can be applied to various domains:  1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information 2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code 3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data 4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions 5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks  ### Project Ideas  Here are some practical agent projects you could build:  1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts 2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses 3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities 4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation 5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work  ### Best Practices  1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations 2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable 3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures 4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency 5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent  ### Limitations and Challenges  Current LLM agents face several challenges:  1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls 2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities 3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead 4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks 5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Llm Evals", "filename": "llm-evals.md", "content": "## LLM Evaluations with PromptFoo  Test-drive your prompts and models with automated, reliable evaluations.

[![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)  This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields.

Practice with these resources:  - [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries - [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing - [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions  ### Command-line JSON Processing with jq  [jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.  **Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.  ```bash # Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'  # Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'  # Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})' ```  ### JMESPath Queries  [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.  **Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.  ```python import jmespath  # Example queries data = {     \"locations\": [         {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},         {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}     ] }  # Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data) ```  ### Streaming with ijson  Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.  **Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.  ```python import ijson  async def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:     \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"     results = []      with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:         # Stream objects under the 'items' key         parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')         async for item in parser:             if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally                 results.append(item)      return results ```  ### Pandas JSON Columns  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.  **Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.  ```python import pandas as pd  # Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) df['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)  # Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') df_normalized = pd.json_normalize(     df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),     record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack     meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent ) ```  ### SQL JSON Functions  [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html). This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.  **Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.  ```sql SELECT     json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,     json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age FROM users WHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true ```  ### DuckDB JSON Processing  [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.  **Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.  ```sql SELECT     json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,     avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100 ```"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Profiling Data With Python", "filename": "profiling-data-with-python.md", "content": "## Profile Data with Python  [![Discover the data profile with Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kFVxdBhLa_A/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/kFVxdBhLa_A)  This session covers the use of the `pandas_profiling` library for generating comprehensive data reports in Python:  - **Library Installation and Import**: Learn how to install and import the pandas_profiling library. - **Profile Report Generation**: Generate an HTML report with a single line of code using ProfileReport. - **Descriptive Statistics**: View detailed descriptive statistics such as variance, standard deviation, and kurtosis. - **Outlier Detection**: Identify and analyze outliers within the dataset. - **Correlation Analysis**: Understand how variables are correlated with each other using visual representations. - **Handling Missing Values**: Get insights on missing data and decide on imputation or removal strategies. - **Initial Data Insights**: Use the report to gather early warnings and insights before starting the data cleaning and modeling process.

Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025.  For questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277).  ## Background  You have joined the operations team at **DataWorks Solutions**, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.  Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.  Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain\u2011English tasks, carries out the required (multi\u2011step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre\u2011computed expected results.  ## Create an API  Write an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:  - **POST `/run?task=`**   Executes a plain\u2011English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.   - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response   - If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response   - If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response   - The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases - **GET `/read?path=`**   Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.   - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text   - If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body  ## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks  The DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:  - **A1**. Install `uv` (if required) and run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (**NOTE**: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.) - **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place - **A3**. The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` - **A4**. Sort the array of contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json` - **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first - **A6**. Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# `). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}`) - **A7**. `/data/email.txt` contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email address to `/data/email-sender.txt` - **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - **A9**. `/data/comments.txt` contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to `/data/comments-similar.txt`, one per line - **A10**. The SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write the number in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`  Developers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.  For example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.  - The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` - Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt` - `/data/contents.log` \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0930\u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u0902? \u0917\u093f\u0928\u094b \u0914\u0930 /data/contents.dates \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u093f\u0916\u094b - `/data/contents.log`\u0bb2 \u0b8e\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bc8 \u0b9e\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba9\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0ba3\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1, \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bc8 `/data/contents.dates`\u0bb2 \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1  Your task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.  ## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks  The DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:  - **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it - **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it  The DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:  - **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it - **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit - **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database - **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website - **B7**. Compress or resize an image - **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML - **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data  Your agent must handle these tasks as well.  The business team has _not_ promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a **bonus** if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.  ## Deliverables  - [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) - [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) - Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files. - Commit and push your code - Create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) that builds your application - Publish your Docker image _publicly_ to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) - Ensure that running your image via `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...` - [Submit in this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog)   the URL of your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`)  Note:  - **Use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable**. DON'T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before running your script. Use `os.environ[\"AIPROXY_TOKEN\"]` as the token in your script. - **Use your AI Proxy token**. Your [AI Proxy token](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.) - **Stick to GPT-4o-Mini**. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says \"LLM\", it means GPT-4o-Mini. - **Keep your prompts short and concise**. Each call to `/run` and `/read` must complete within 20 seconds.  ## Evaluation  This [evaluation script](project-1/evaluate.py) evaluates the scripts.Here's how will evaluate a task, e.g. **Task A2**.  1. Call `POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2`. Ensure that the respose is a HTTP 200.    - Note: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same. 2. Call `GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` and get the revised file contents. 3. Verify that the response was formatted using `prettier@3.4.2`.  Here's how we will score the results.  - **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation   - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible   - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license   - Your GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile`   - Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`   - Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository - **Phase A: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase A task that the agent handles correctly.   - We will run an evaluation script that will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output - **Phase B: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase B task that the agent handles correctly.   - The evaluation script will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output - **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We _may_ pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task. - **Bonus: Code diversity**. You're encouraged to copy code and learn from each other. We encourage diversity too. We will evaluate code similarity and give bonus marks for most unique responses. (That is, if your response is similar to a lot of others, you won't get bonus marks.)  Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization, i.e. whether it's 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get.  This execution will be automated via:  - [`validate.py`](project-1/validate.py) to check the pre-requisites and generate the eligible `images.txt` - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=...` to set the AI Proxy token - [`run.sh`](project-1/run.sh) to evaluate all submissions."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Project 2", "filename": "project-2.md", "content": "# Project 2 - TDS Solver  This project is due on 31 Mar 2025 EoD IST.

For questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029).  ## Background  You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/) course.  To make your life easier, you have decided to build an LLM-based application that can automatically answer any of the graded assignment questions.  Specifically, you are building and deploying an API that accepts any question from one of these 5 graded assignments:  - [Graded Assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) - [Graded Assignment 2](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2) - [Graded Assignment 3](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3) - [Graded Assignment 4](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4) - [Graded Assignment 5](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5)  ... and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.  ## Create an API  Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`.  The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.  For example, here's how anyone can make a request:  ```bash curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\   -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\   -F \"question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the CSV file?\" \\   -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" ```  The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:  ```json {   \"answer\": \"1234567890\" } ```  ## Deploy your application  Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.  (If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)  ## Share your code  - [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) - [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) - Commit and push your code  ## Submit your URL  Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL in this Google Form: .  ## Evaluation  - **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation   - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible   - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license - We will send 5 questions _randomly_ chosen from the graded assignments above.

You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) course.  Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:  - [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. - [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.  ## Scrape the data  To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.  ## Create an API  Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.  The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.

One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.  The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:  - [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/) - [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design) - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)  Here are some best practices:  ### Use prompt optimizers  They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:  - [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver) - [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation) - [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)  ### Be clear, direct, and detailed  Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.  - **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) - **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)  > When you ask a question, don\u2019t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. > The clearer you are, the better the answer you\u2019ll get. > For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. > Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy.  [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)  ### Give examples  Provide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.  - **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) - **GOOD**:   _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_    1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._   2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._    _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)  > Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don\u2019t just say \u2018build something.\u2019 > Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.

This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.  - **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) - **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)  > Ask the model to think step by step. Don\u2019t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. > That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. > Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves \u2014 like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. > For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.

This provides context and helps tailor the response style.  - **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.) - **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)  > Tell the model who they are. Maybe they\u2019re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. > By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. > Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it\u2019s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.

This helps the model understand structure and requirements.  - **BAD**: _Here\u2019s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) - **GOOD**:   ```xml        Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.           Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).      ```   (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)  > Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. > They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.  [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)  ### Use Markdown to format your output  Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.  - **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) - **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) - **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) - **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)  > Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. > You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. > These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.  ### Use JSON for machine-readable output  When you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.  - **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) - **GOOD**:    ````markdown   Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:    ```json   [     { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },     { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },     { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }   ]   ```   ````    (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)  Note: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.  > Imagine you\u2019re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find what you need later. > JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. > Everything has its place: fields like \u2018name,\u2019 \u2018description,\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 make the data easy to read, especially for machines. > For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. > That way, when you hand it to a program, it\u2019s all clear and ready to use.  ### Prefer Yes/No answers  Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.  - **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) - **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what\u2019s being asked.)  > Don\u2019t ask \u2018On a scale of one to five...\u2019. Models are not good with numbers. > They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 is simple. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s quick. > So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.  ### Ask for reason first, then the answer  Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.  - **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) - **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you\u2019ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)  > BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. > That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.  ### Use proper spelling and grammar  A well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.  - **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.) - **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)  > If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. > When you do, the response will be much clearer.  ## Video Tutorials  Watch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial \u2013 Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o).

Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain\u2011specific questions without fine\u2011tuning.  In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:  ```bash Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" # Answer: fat arrow  Q=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" # Answer: node.getChildren()  Q=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren\u2019t in the AST called?\" # Answer: trivia  Q=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" # Answer: !! ```  You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.  ### 1. Clone the repository  ```bash git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book cd typescript-book ```  - `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size. - `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder.  You'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo.  ### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks  ```bash (   shopt -s globstar   for f in **/*.md; do     uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\     | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\     | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '       split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]       | to_entries       | map({           id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),           content: .value         })[]     '   done ) | tee chunks.json ```  - `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html) - `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github.com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM\u2011sized chunks:   - `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT\u20114o token limits   - `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk   - `--separator \"===SPLIT===\"`: custom split marker - `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual) - `jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\"`: uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON   - `-R`: read raw input   - `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string   - `-c`: compact JSON output   - builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex` - `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout.  You'll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.  ### 3. Generate embeddings  ```bash llm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json ```  - `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`. - `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage. - `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model. - `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend. - `--format nl`: input is newline\u2011delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)  This stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.  ```bash llm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored llm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection ```  ### 4. Find similar topics  ```bash llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" ```  This returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.  - `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store. - `-n 3`: return three results. - `-c`: the user\u2019s query string.  ### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context  ```bash Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\   | jq '.content' \\   | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\   | uvx streamdown ```  This answers the question in natural language following these steps:  1. Store the query in `Q`. 2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks. 3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets. 4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:    - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.    - `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded. 5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading."}, {"type": "book", "title": "Rawgraphs", "filename": "rawgraphs.md", "content": "## RAWgraphs  [![RAWGraphs 1.0 - Introduction (1 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2TtYlty-M5g/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/2TtYlty-M5g)  - [RAWgraphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) - [How to make Alluvial Diagram](https://youtu.be/6BYac2Pmnno) - [How to make Sankey Diagram](https://youtu.be/DYTiKjH6oFM) - [How to make Beeswarm Plot](https://youtu.be/RPHiEzbCatA) - [How to make Bump Chart](https://youtu.be/K-weHCSQb58) - [How to make Circle Packing](https://youtu.be/inm_fR-oykw) - [How to make Treemap](https://youtu.be/W_MuNYWjhfc) - [How to make Streamgraph](https://youtu.be/Iu8Me9QO8mg) - [How to make Sunburst Diagram](https://youtu.be/knqimV7RVbI) - [How to make Voronoi Diagram](https://youtu.be/I7nn29giVug) - [How to make Hexagonal Binning](https://youtu.be/Q03sVDj32l4)"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Regression With Excel", "filename": "regression-with-excel.md", "content": "## Regression with Excel  [![Regression with Excel](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/AERQBMIHwXA/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/AERQBMIHwXA)  You'll learn to perform regression analysis using Excel, covering:  - **Data Preparation**: Understanding the cleaned dataset and necessary columns for analysis. - **Enabling the Tool**: How to enable the Data Analysis Tool Pack in Excel. - **Types of Regression**: Differences between simple and multiple linear regression. - **Setting Up Regression**: Steps to input dependent (new deaths) and independent variables (new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, stringency index) for the analysis. - **Interpreting Output**: Reading the regression output, focusing on adjusted R-squared, significance value (F-test), and P-values. - **Coefficient Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, including scaling factors (per 1000 units). - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model based on significance values and understanding the implications of unexpected results (e.g., stringency index). - **Further Analysis**: Recognizing the need for additional analysis when encountering unexpected or inconclusive results.

They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:  - A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) - A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) - A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) - A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) - A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)  You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!  Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:  - You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt` - You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. - You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.  Here's a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file.  To deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency.  ```text fastapi ```  Add your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`.  ```python # main.py from fastapi import FastAPI  app = FastAPI()  @app.get(\"/\") def read_root():     return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"} ```  Add a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository.  ```json {   \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],   \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }] } ```  On the command line, run:  - `npx vercel` to deploy a test version - `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production  **Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them.  ### Videos  [![Vercel Product Walkthrough](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sPmat30SE4k/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sPmat30SE4k)  [![Deploy FastAPI on Vercel | Quick and Easy Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8R-cetf_sZ4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8R-cetf_sZ4)"}, {"type": "book", "title": "Vision Models", "filename": "vision-models.md", "content": "## Vision Models  [![LLM Vision Models](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/FgT_Mk_bakQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/FgT_Mk_bakQ)  You'll learn how to use LLMs to interpret images and extract useful information, covering:  - **Setting Up Vision Models**: Integrate vision capabilities with LLMs using APIs like OpenAI's Chat Completion. - **Sending Image URLs for Analysis**: Pass URLs or base64-encoded images to LLMs for processing. - **Reading Image Responses**: Get detailed textual descriptions of images, from scenic landscapes to specific objects like cricketers or bank statements. - **Extracting Data from Images**: Convert extracted image data to various formats like Markdown tables or JSON arrays. - **Handling Model Hallucinations**: Address inaccuracies in extraction results, understanding how different prompts can affect output quality. - **Cost Management for Vision Models**: Adjust detail settings (e.g., \"detail: low\") to balance cost and output precision.
